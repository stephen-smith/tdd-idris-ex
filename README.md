Answers to the "Exercises" sections from the book "Type-Driven Development with
Idris" by Edwin Brady.  Module names used are inferred from the REPL examples
in the book.  Doc comments include the suggested REPL examples (formatted for
possible later doctest extraction) and potentially short descriptions from the
book, which should fall under "fair use", but will be removed upon request.

While I strongly recommend working the answer out for yourself, this is
provided in the hopes that more people learn Idris and begin to leverage the
power of dependant types to improve software quality in general.

Solutions provided might not be uniuqely correct, and might even be incorrect.
Use at your own risk.
